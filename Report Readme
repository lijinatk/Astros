### Project Description
 

Bands typically consist of multiple members, each specializing in different instruments or roles, such as vocals, guitar, bass, drums, keyboard, or even electronic elements.


### The Problem statement
The lack of an integrated platform to handle these aspects can result in missed opportunities, disorganization, and inefficient communication both internally within the band and externally with their fanbase.


### The Solution
A musical band is a group of musicians who come together to create, perform, and record music as a collective unit.
